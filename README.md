### ng-time-traveler

A POC attempt to provide a package that allows defining angular 1 components & directives using angular 2 syntax.
The benefits are priceless...

Built so it parts can be replaced (using a "new router" adapter instead of the existing "ngRoute" adapter)...

TODO:
  - Check performance
  - Explore supporting property & events for @Component
  - Test that ES5 is working (ES5 DSL & ES5 annotation)
  - Arrange package.json (a lot of garbage)
  - Arrange code structure, especially in src/ng
